Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. It's essential for understanding change and motion.

## Differential Calculus

### Derivatives
The derivative of a function represents the rate of change at any given point.

**Basic derivative rules:**
- Power rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- Product rule: d/dx(fg) = f'g + fg'
- Chain rule: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))g'(x)

### Applications
- Finding slopes of tangent lines
- Optimization problems
- Related rates

## Integral Calculus

### Integrals
Integration is the reverse process of differentiation, used to find areas under curves.

**Basic integration rules:**
- ∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C
- ∫e^x dx = e^x + C
- ∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C

### Applications
- Finding areas and volumes
- Solving differential equations
- Physics applications (work, energy)

## Getting Started

Practice with simple functions first, then gradually work up to more complex problems. Remember that calculus is the foundation for many advanced mathematical concepts!
