Here are some projects I've worked on:

## Publications

## RL & Explainable AI

###### Leader-Follower Dynamics in Multi-Agent RL
By strength of heart or rate of state conversion, one agent will become leader and one follower.

###### Layerwise Relevance Propagation for Feature Networks
Unfortunately, black-box saliency maps seem to be edge detectors. If a confused model calls a picture of an elephant a giraffe, and the interpretability method says the model thinks it's an elephant, it's not a very good interpretability method now is it.

## Statistics & Machine Learning

###### ITS with Multilevel Integer-Valued GARCHs 
Aka the ITSMLZINBINGARCHX. Thank you Stan for allowing this behemoth to converge. A win for partial pooling, and another success for classical time series forecasting.

###### Social Ties and the 2025 Presidential Election
Remember that French "whale" who made a fortune on polymarket betting on neighbor polling? Well, let's see whether he was on to something or just on the right side of variance.

###### Cost-Effective Lead Sampling with GPs
The perfect use case for high-dimensional Bayesian Gaussian processes. If we can guess where the lead *isn't* in a containment site (and be confident about it) then we don't need to dig it all up!
